People of world this is not just a github repo, this is a patch-fix for the Economy, Basically we want to give to the world the opportunity to Make Great Games and also making the open source community together, because together we can survive.
please be patient, process is a long road and every merged commit is a choice that will affect us, please choose your words wisely.

The Idea behind this is to make an Infinite currency that is driven only by the power of collective will, if want to save this world, start coding NOW !

Formula : 
Starting from ethereum, we build a new currency, this currency is the only currency that will be used in this project, If you don't like it, you can always fork this repo and build your own project.
We will use a gamified system for the reward for contribution.

Metamorph is a game engine that is designed in a way that cannot be hacked, because it's open source, using only cryptomoney that anyone can mine, but also you have the choice to just contribute to the code if you don't want to mine even if you don't know a list of amazing tutorial will be provided. 

# Metamorph Engine
Metamorph is using the simplicity of Unity, with the Unreal Engine Quality where you can code with any language at any point.
this engine is modular and will only use the libraries you need.

Crypto : MTC / MTX implementation with bitcore (timetravel + segwit)

Basically building a wrapping (Glue) plateform for developers to make the best game engine ever,

1- look for the best solution 
2- submit solutions 
3- Claim MetaToken

After building the MVP we will take a snapshot on the GIT repo and we will offer developers to ability claim their MTX
